# DCGAN reservoir simulation
We formulate a deep convolutional generative adversarial network model to build up the dynamic mapping between permeability and gas saturation distribution after injection gas. The gas saturation distribution at a different time was obtained by image mapping with the input data of the permeability field, then the gas channeling can be predicted. The results indicate that the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network(DC-GAN) method shows superior performance in permeability feature representations. Using the structural similarity index (SSIM) as test index, compared to the mapping relationship gained from DC-GAN and the results calculated from the commercial reservoir simulator, we learn that the driving process of injecting gas can be predicted precisely from the DC-GAN model and the SSIM is more than 0.9. The results show that the DC-GAN model can predict the channeling direction of gas injected in reservoir.
